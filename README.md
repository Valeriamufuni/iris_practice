# iris_practice


First training project


Dataset: Iris flower. The dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

Tasks todo: 1) find min, max and mean of each column (sepal lenght, sepal width, petal length, petal width) except of column "name".
            2) delete 10% of raws from the begining and from the end of the dataset
